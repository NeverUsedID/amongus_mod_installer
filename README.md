What are the scripts do:
- Search for Among Us Folder
- download the mod (downloadpath hardcoded in script)
- asks to download and install better crewlink (download path hardcoded in script)
- check if bettercrewlink server is https://bettercrewl.ink
- create a mod folder in the subfolder from the found among us.
